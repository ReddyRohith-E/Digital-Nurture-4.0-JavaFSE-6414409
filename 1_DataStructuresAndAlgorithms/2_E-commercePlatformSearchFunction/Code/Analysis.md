# Analysis: Linear vs Binary Search

## Linear Search
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- Each item is checked one by one until the target is found or the end is reached.
- Does not require the data to be sorted.
- **Best Case:** O(1) (target is the first item)
- **Worst Case:** O(n) (target is the last item or not present)

## Binary Search
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)
- The search range is halved with each step, quickly narrowing down the possible location.
- Requires the data to be sorted beforehand.
- **Best Case:** O(1) (target is at the middle)
- **Worst Case:** O(log n)

## Recommendation
- For large and sorted product lists, binary search is much more efficient and recommended.
- For small or unsorted lists, linear search is simple and effective.
- I recommend using binary search for the product list in the e-commerce application, as it will significantly reduce search time for users looking for specific products.
