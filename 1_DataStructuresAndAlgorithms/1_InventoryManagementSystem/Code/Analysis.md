# Inventory Management System: Data Structure and Algorithm Analysis

## Why Data Structures and Algorithms Matter

Running a warehouse or business means keeping track of lots of products—and doing it efficiently is key. The right data structures and algorithms make everyday tasks like searching, adding, updating, or deleting products much faster and more reliable, no matter how big your inventory gets. This leads to smoother operations, better performance, and easier maintenance as your business grows.

## Choosing the Right Data Structures

- **ArrayList**: This is straightforward and easy to use, but if you need to find, update, or remove a product by its ID, it can be slow (since it may have to look through every item).
- **HashMap**: This structure links each product ID to its product details, making it super quick to find, update, or delete products (usually in constant time, no matter how many products you have). It’s a great fit for inventories where every product has a unique ID.

## How the System Works

- **Product Class**: Each product is represented by a class with details like productId, productName, quantity, and price.
- **Inventory Storage**: By using a `HashMap<Integer, Product>`, you can quickly look up, add, update, or remove products using their IDs.
- **Main Operations**:
  - **Add**: Insert a new product into the map.
  - **Update**: Replace the product in the map if it already exists.
  - **Delete**: Remove a product from the map using its ID.

## How Fast Are These Operations?

| Operation | Data Structure | Time Complexity |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Add       | HashMap       | O(1) average   |
| Update    | HashMap       | O(1) average   |
| Delete    | HashMap       | O(1) average   |

- **Add**: Adding a new product is quick and doesn’t slow down as your inventory grows.
- **Update**: Updating a product is just as fast, since the system can jump straight to the right item.
- **Delete**: Removing a product by its ID is also efficient for the same reason.

## Tips for Optimizing Your Inventory System

- For most cases, a `HashMap` is the best choice for fast lookups by product ID.
- If you want your products sorted (like by name or price), a `TreeMap` keeps things in order, though it’s a bit slower (O(log n) time).
- If you need to search by other fields (not just product ID), you might want to add extra data structures or indexes.

By using these approaches, your inventory management system will stay fast, responsive, and easy to maintain—even as your product list grows.
